# blackholerenderer
raymarch thing with acreation disk to render schwarzschild black holes

W&S to move, A&D to look around, Q&E to do stuff

colors aren't accurate yet, but it should be pretty realistic in physics or something (it's not)

planned stuff: schwarzschild radius, make it a rotating black hole and add the doppler effect thing
probably not gonna work but hey, can't I dream!
